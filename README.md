This project was really cool to produce. In it, I learned some things about object orientation and reused a complex weapons system that I had made in another project, thus improving my system.

The game is just an arena where enemies are spawned and the player has to survive.

They also made a poorly made weapons depot, but it works in the gameplay.

I intend to start a new project from scratch using things made here.
